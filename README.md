# C++ VSCode Template

This repository provides a ready-to-use template for setting up a C++ development environment in Visual Studio Code using CMake and Docker. It includes popular libraries such as Boost, googletest, fmtlib, and nlohmann/json, along with essential development tools, all pre-configured in a Devcontainer.

To play around with this, ensure you have VSCode and the [Remote Development extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) installed. Then, simply click the button below:

[![Open in Remote - Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Remote%20-%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/semyonkozlov/cpp-vscode-template)

VSCode will automatically clone the repository, set up the Devcontainer (this may take some time), and prepare the environment for development.
