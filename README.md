# C++ VSCode Template

This repository provides a template for setting up a C++ development environment with Visual Studio Code, CMake, and Docker. It includes configuration for some popular libraries.

Ensure you have VSCode and the [Remote Development extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) installed, then click the button below:

[![Open in Remote - Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Remote%20-%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/semyonkozlov/cpp-vscode-template)

VSCode will clone the repository and set up the Devcontainer, which may take some time, and then it will be ready for development.
